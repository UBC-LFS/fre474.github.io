    "text": "Description\nSeveral important drivers of human activity are economic. Human activity is responsible for large scale deforestation; the conversion of grasslands; the extraction of minerals/fossil fuels; global climate change; and an ongoing sixth mass extinction.\nIn this course we will see how researchers use data to examine the economics of natural resource use. You will learn how one can ‘infer’ (in the statistical sense) the human (economic) ‘cause’ of natural resource use.\nMy current research interest is in wildlife conservation, so I will focus on issues related to forests and wildlife. We will consider questions like: What are the drivers of species loss, and which environmental policies have been successful in halting it? Is there a trade-off between poverty alleviation and the conservation of charismatic species, coral reefs, and/or tropical rainforests? Does endangered species legislation impact species conservation, and employment?\nI will introduce empirical methods necessary to evaluate the causal impact of economic development and environmental policies on conservation outcomes using a hybrid format. Methods will be presented using pre-recorded lectures, combined with online exercises and quizzes. In our synchronous zoom interactions we will read, interpret, and analyse the use of these techniques through in-class exercises, and academic articles addressing the questions listed above.\nAll students will submit a final project, where they will employ either STATA or R to implement one of the causal techniques they learn in class using a pre-compiled dataset provided to them."

While writing this reflection you are required to relate something you learnt in class to the world around you. You can relate a topic from class something you read in the news, or something you experienced in life. The possibilities are up to you. The reflection cannot exceed 400 words, but can be shorter. If the reflection makes sense, it will be assigned a 2 participation points, if submitted but hard to understand, it will get 1 participation point, and if not submitted will earn 0. There will be a recurring assignment on canvas for you submit this reflection.\nA Referee Report: Students will choose a paper from the syllabus and will write a two page report in which they: a) summarize the paper (half a page), b) highlight what the paper does well (half a page), and c) suggest improvements to their analysis of data in answering the question posed (one page).\nFinal project: More detail will be provided in the first two weeks of class (this part of the syllabus will be updated subsequently).\nThe assignments will be online and based on material from the lectures and readings.

    "section": "University Policies",
    "text": "University Policies\nUBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.\nDetails of the policies and how to access support are available on the UBC Senate website.\n\nAcademic Accommodation for Students\nThe University accommodates students with disabilities who have registered with the Disability Resource Centre. The University also accommodates students whose religious obligations conflict with attendance or scheduled tests or exams. Other absences for varsity athletics, family obligations or other similar commitments are not part of University policy and students should not assume that they would be accommodated. Academic accommodations help students with a disability or ongoing medical condition overcome challenges that may affect their academic success. Students requiring academic accommodations must register with Access and Diversity. A and D will determine that student’s eligibility for accommodations in accordance with Policy 73: Academic Accommodation for Students with Disabilities. Your instructors do not determine academic accommodations, however, your instructor may consult with Access and Diversity should the accommodations affect the essential learning outcomes of a course. If you have a pressing issue those conflicts with an exam, you should discuss this with your instructor as soon as possible. Refer to the UBC Calendar for details of ‘academic concession.’\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.\nAt the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.\nViolations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences."

There will be 3 in-class assignments/quizzes that you will do either online, or in person as the term progresses. Your two highest grades on that will count towards your grade.\nParticipation Grade: You will have to come prepared to the class, and you will be expected to discuss the assigned material in class.\nEvery two weeks you will submit on canvas a short reflection of the what you learnt in class in the previous fortnight. While writing this reflection you are required to relate something you learnt in class to the world around you. You can relate a topic from class something you read in the news, or something you experienced in life. The possibilities are up to you. The reflection cannot exceed 400 words, but can be shorter. If the reflection makes sense, it will be assigned 2 participation points, if submitted but hard to understand, it will get 1 participation point, and if not submitted will earn 0. There will be a recurring assignment on Canvas for you submit this reflection.\nA Referee Report: Students will choose a paper from the syllabus and will write a two page report in which they: a) summarize the paper (half a page), b) highlight what the paper does well (half a page), and c) suggest improvements to their analysis of data in answering the question posed (one page). Academic papers outside of those listed in the syllabus can be chosen with permission.\nFinal project: More detail will be provided in the first two weeks of class (this part of the syllabus will be updated subsequently).\nThe assignments will be online and based on material from the lectures and readings. In-class assignments/quizzes will cover material in lectures and readings."

    "section": "University Policies",
    "text": "University Policies\nUBC provides resources to support student learning and to maintain healthy lifestyles but recognizes that sometimes crises arise and so there are additional resources to access including those for survivors of sexual violence. UBC values respect for the person and ideas of all members of the academic community. Harassment and discrimination are not tolerated nor is suppression of academic freedom. UBC provides appropriate accommodation for students with disabilities and for religious observances. UBC values academic honesty and students are expected to acknowledge the ideas generated by others and to uphold the highest academic standards in all of their actions.\nDetails of the policies and how to access support are available on the UBC Senate website.\n\nAcademic Accommodation for Students\nThe University accommodates students with disabilities who have registered with the Disability Resource Centre. The University also accommodates students whose religious obligations conflict with attendance or scheduled tests or exams. Other absences for varsity athletics, family obligations or other similar commitments are not part of University policy and students should not assume that they would be accommodated. Academic accommodations help students with a disability or ongoing medical condition overcome challenges that may affect their academic success. Students requiring academic accommodations must register with Access and Diversity. A and D will determine that student’s eligibility for accommodations in accordance with Policy 73: Academic Accommodation for Students with Disabilities. Your instructors do not determine academic accommodations, however, your instructor may consult with Access and Diversity should the accommodations affect the essential learning outcomes of a course. If you have a pressing issue those conflicts with an exam, you should discuss this with your instructor as soon as possible. Refer to the UBC Calendar for details of ‘academic concession.’\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity.\nAt the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work.\nViolations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences."
