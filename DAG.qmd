title: "Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)"
---

We're going to do an exercise to draw a DAG.

We're going to use [ggdag](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggdag/vignettes/intro-to-ggdag.html). Make sure you have the necessary packages installed.

```{r}
library(dagitty)
library(ggdag)
library(ggplot2)

dag <- dagitty("dag{y <- z -> x}")
ggdag(dag, layout = "circle")

```
